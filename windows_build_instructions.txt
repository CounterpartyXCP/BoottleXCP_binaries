How to make the BoottleXCP executable package for Windows  (by flatfly)
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =


This build process has been designed with the following objectives in mind:

- 100% open-source toolchain 
- same build runs on 32-bit and 64-bit architectures
- steps are easy to replicate on a vanilla Windows machine
- no administrative credentials required


(The plan is to move to a fully automated process later on.)


There are 2 ways to build BoottleXCP:  Starting from scratch or starting from a previous build.


Method 1: Starting from scratch

	 a/ Pre-requisites
	 
	 	0/ Windows XP or later - An English-locale 32-bit Windows XP VM is recommended, to 
	 	   make builds that are both 32-bit and 64-bit compatible without too much pain.
	 	   
		1/ Install 7-Zip 9.20.0.0
		   http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sevenzip/

		2/ Install AutoHotkey Basic interpreter  1.0.48.5
		   http://ahkscript.org/download/

		3/ Install AutoHotkey Basic compiler     1.0.48.5
		   http://ahkscript.org/download/

		4/ BoottleXCP (+ counterpartyd + dependencies): extract into a directory of your choice, which is 
		   referred to as "%BoottleXCP_Path%" in the rest of these instructions
	           Also see http://www.reddit.com/r/xcp/comments/1zzhyg/how_to_install_counterparty_windows_gui_wallet_by/
	    

	 b/ Make the setup.arc file by running the following command:
	    start /wait 7za a "setup.arc" "%BoottleXCP_Path%" -r -sfx, d:\deliverables
	    

	 c/ Compile the AHK1 wrapper script using the AutoHotkey Basic compiler:
	    start /wait Ahk2Exe /in "%BoottleXCP_Path%\windows_boottleXCP-flatwrapper.ahk1" 

   

Method 2: Starting from a previous installation

  
(Work in progress... I'm also by reachable by PM on forums.counterparty.co for help regarding these instructions)

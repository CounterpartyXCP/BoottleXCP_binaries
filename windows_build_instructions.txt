How to make the BoottleXCP executable package for Windows
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =


Currently the BoottleXCP build process for Windows is as follows.
(The plan is to move to a fully automated process later on.)


There are 2 ways to do it.

A/ Starting from scratch

	 a/ Requirements
	 	0/ Windows XP or later - A 32-bit Windows XP VM is recommended, to make builds that are both
	 	   32-bit and 64-bit compatible.
	 	   
		1/ 7-Zip 9.20.0.0
		   http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sevenzip/

		2/ AutoHotkey Basic interpreter  1.0.48.5
		   http://ahkscript.org/download/

		3/ AutoHotkey Basic compiler     1.0.48.5
		   http://ahkscript.org/download/

		4/ BoottleXCP (+ dependencies) source: extract it into a directory of your choice, which is 
		   referred to as "%BoottleXCP_Path%" in the rest of these instructions
	           Also see http://www.reddit.com/r/xcp/comments/1zzhyg/how_to_install_counterparty_windows_gui_wallet_by/
	    

	 b/ Make the setup.arc file by running the following command:
	    start /wait 7za.exe a "setup.arc" "%BoottleXCP_Path%" -r -sfx, d:\deliverables
	    

	 c/ Compile the AHK1 wrapper script using the AutoHotkey Basic compiler
   

B/ Starting from a previous installation.

  
(Work in progress... I'm also by reachable by PM on forums.counterparty.co to help with making your own build)
